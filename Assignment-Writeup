#The assingment requires to use the weight lifting exercise data set and create a classification algorithm. The algorithm 
#is to classify the manner in which the subjects perform their exercise (correct and incorrect variations of the same 
#exercise). The study subjects wore motion tracking devices in order to capture various data about their exercise. There 
#are 5 class levels (variations of the same exercise) that are required for training the algorithm and using it to 
#subsequently make predictions on 20 pre-determined out-of-sample examples.

#I downloded the data sets "pml-training.csv" and "pml-testing.csv" directly to my hard-drive and them imported them into
# my work directory in R.

#Call the necessary libraries for the analysis
