#The assingment requires to use the weight lifting exercise data set and create a classification algorithm. The algorithm 
is to classify the manner in which the subjects perform their exercise (correct and incorrect variations of the same 
exercise). The study subjects wore motion tracking devices in order to capture various data about their exercise. There 
are 5 class levels (variations of the same exercise) that are required for training the algorithm and using it to 
subsequently make predictions on 20 pre-determined out-of-sample examples.
