My machine learning (ML) class work

# My name is Alexi Makarkin and this is my work for the final assignment in the Practical Machine Learning class taught by prof. Jeff Leek.

The assingment requires to use the weight lifting exercise data set and create a classification algorithm. The algorithm is to classify the manner in which the subjects perform their exercise (correct and incorrect variations of the same exercise). The study subjects wore motion tracking devices in order to capture various data about their exercise. There are 5 class levels (variations of the same exercise) that are required for training the algorithm and using it to subsequently make predictions on 20 pre-determined out-of-sample examples.
