<p>The assignment requires to use the weight lifting exercise data set and create a classification algorithm. The algorithm 
is to classify the manner in which the subjects perform their exercise (correct and incorrect variations of the same 
exercise). The study subjects wore motion tracking devices in order to capture various data about their exercise. There 
are 5 class levels (variations of the same exercise) that are required for training the algorithm and using it to 
subsequently make predictions on 20 predetermined out-of-sample examples.</p>

<h3>
<a id="data" class="anchor" href="#data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h3>

<p>I downloaded the data sets "pml-training.csv" and "pml-testing.csv" directly to my hard-drive and then imported them into
my work directory in R.</p>

<p>Call the necessary libraries that will be used in the data exploration and algorithm training later.</p>

<pre><code>library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rattle)
</code></pre>

<p>Set Work Directory</p>

<pre><code>setwd("~/Career/Practical_Machine_Learning/Assignments")

<p>Set the seed number if I would like to recreate the exact results later.</p>

<p>160 features are present in the data. The data set with 20 observation will be used to perform the final prediction. 
The "d_trn" data will be be partitioned into training and testing 50/50. Conventionally, the split is typically 60/40,
but I decided to reduce the processing time (random forests take a long time) with the smaller training data set.
The partition is done on the classification target variable "classe."</p>

<p>Upon preliminary data observation, I noticed quite a few field with statistical summaries like standard deviation
curtosis, etc that were derived from the primary exercise repetitions. Many of these fields contained "NA" values.
These fields are not very useful to make predictiions unless the predictions are made on repetitive exercise and
not on a one-time obsevation similar to the ones in the 20 sample data. Features with NA of more than 50% of
observations as well as near zero variance field will be removed.</p>

<p>Among other irrelevant features were the features representing user names, date and time stamps and some indication what
observation window the measurements fell into. These predictors are highly correlated with the outcome variable because
that's how the experiment was designed and conducted. I will remove them accordingly.</p>

<p>Let's determine what predictors have no or little variability in them</p>

<p>wkDataNZV &lt;- nearZeroVar(wkTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
   wkDataNZV</p>

<p>Remove the NZV and irrelevant predictors from the data</p>

<pre><code>wkNZVvars &lt;- names(wkTraining) %in%  c("new_window","num_window","kurtosis_yaw_belt","skewness_yaw_belt",

<p>wkTraining &lt;- wkTraining[!wkNZVvars]</p>

<p>I will also eliminate predictors where NA &gt;= 51%</p>

<pre><code>hldTraining &lt;- wkTraining
for(i in 1:length(wkTraining)) 
{ if(sum( is.na(wkTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(wkTraining) &gt;= .51 ) #NAs &gt; 51% of total Ns
{for(j in 1:length(hldTraining))
{if(length( grep(names(wkTraining[i]), names(hldTraining)[j]) ) ==1)  #if same name
{hldTraining &lt;- hldTraining[ , -j] #Remove that variable}   
 }      }}

dim(hldTraining)

<pre><code>rm(wkTraining)
wkTraining &lt;- hldTraining
rm(hldTraining)

<p>Only 53 features remain in the data after irrelevant predictors have been removed.</p>
