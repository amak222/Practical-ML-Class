{"name":"Practical Machine Learning Project","tagline":"My machine learning (ML) class work","body":"### Project Objective\r\nThe assignment requires to use the weight lifting exercise data set and create a classification algorithm. The algorithm \r\nis to classify the manner in which the subjects perform their exercise (correct and incorrect variations of the same \r\nexercise). The study subjects wore motion tracking devices in order to capture various data about their exercise. There \r\nare 5 class levels (variations of the same exercise) that are required for training the algorithm and using it to \r\nsubsequently make predictions on 20 predetermined out-of-sample examples.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nI downloaded the data sets \"pml-training.csv\" and \"pml-testing.csv\" directly to my hard-drive and then imported them into\r\nmy work directory in R.\r\n\r\nCall the necessary libraries that will be used in the data exploration and algorithm training later.\r\n\r\n    library(lattice)\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    library(caret)\r\n    library(rpart)\r\n    library(rattle)\r\n\r\n### Reading the Files Into the Work Directory\r\n\r\nSet Work Directory\r\n\r\n    setwd(\"~/Career/Practical_Machine_Learning/Assignments\")\r\n\r\nSet the seed number if I would like to recreate the exact results later.\r\n\r\n    set.seed(1357)\r\n\r\nRead In The files\r\n\r\n    d_trn <- read.csv(\"pml-training.csv\", header=TRUE,na.strings=c(\"NA\",\"#DIV/0!\",\"\"))\r\n    d_tst <- read.csv(\"pml-testing.csv\", header=TRUE,na.strings=c(\"NA\",\"#DIV/0!\",\"\"))\r\n    dim(d_trn); dim(d_tst)\r\n\r\nRows and columns\r\n[1] 19622    160\r\n[1]  20      160\r\n\r\n160 features are present in the data. The data set with 20 observation will be used to perform the final prediction. \r\nThe \"d_trn\" data will be be partitioned into training and testing 50/50. Conventionally, the split is typically 60/40,\r\nbut I decided to reduce the processign time (random forests take a long time) with the smaller training data set.\r\nThe partition is done on the classification target variable \"classe.\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
