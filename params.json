{"name":"Practical Machine Learning Project","tagline":"My machine learning (ML) class work","body":"### Project Objective\r\nThe assignment requires to use the weight lifting exercise data set and create a classification algorithm. The algorithm \r\nis to classify the manner in which the subjects perform their exercise (correct and incorrect variations of the same \r\nexercise). The study subjects wore motion tracking devices in order to capture various data about their exercise. There \r\nare 5 class levels (variations of the same exercise) that are required for training the algorithm and using it to \r\nsubsequently make predictions on 20 predetermined out-of-sample examples.\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nI downloded the data sets \"pml-training.csv\" and \"pml-testing.csv\" directly to my hard-drive and them imported them into\r\n# my work directory in R.\r\n\r\nCall the necessary libraries that will be used in the data exploration and algorithm training later.\r\n    library(lattice)\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    library(caret)\r\n    library(rpart)\r\n    library(rattle)\r\n\r\n### TBD","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
